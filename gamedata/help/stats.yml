  name: Health
  description: Increasing Health increases the maximum health the creature has. When this goes to 0 for heroes, the hero will be incapacitated until they either get revived. When all heroes are incapacitated, they will travel to the nearest Town to recover. Sometimes, Health is used in spells as a secondary stat. In these cases, these spells scale with the creatures maximum health, not current health.
